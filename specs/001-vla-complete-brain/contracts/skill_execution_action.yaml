# ROS 2 Action Interface: SkillExecutionAction

## Overview
Action interface for executing robot skills with monitoring and error handling.

## Action Definition

```yaml
# Request: Contains skill parameters for execution
action: SkillExecutionAction

request:
  # Type of skill to execute
  skill_type: string  # "grasp", "navigate", "place", etc.

  # Parameters specific to the skill
  skill_params: object

  # Execution constraints
  constraints:
    timeout: float  # Maximum execution time in seconds
    max_retries: int  # Maximum number of retry attempts
    safety_limits: object  # Safety constraints for the skill

result:
  # Success status
  success: bool

  # Execution result details
  result_details:
    execution_time: float  # Actual execution time in seconds
    error_code: string  # Error code if execution failed
    error_description: string  # Human-readable error description
    final_state: string  # Robot's final state after execution

  # Metrics collected during execution
  metrics:
    success_rate: float  # Historical success rate for this skill
    average_time: float  # Average execution time for this skill
    resource_usage: object  # CPU, memory, etc. usage during execution

feedback:
  # Current execution stage
  execution_stage: string  # "init", "pre_condition_check", "execution", "post_condition_check", "cleanup"

  # Execution progress percentage
  progress: float  # 0.0 to 1.0

  # Current status message
  status_message: string

  # Estimated time remaining
  estimated_time_remaining: float
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Grasp Skill
```
request:
  skill_type: "grasp"
  skill_params:
    target_object: "red cup"
    grasp_type: "pinch"
    approach_angle: 45.0
    force_limit: 10.0
  constraints:
    timeout: 30.0
    max_retries: 3
    safety_limits:
      max_force: 20.0
      max_current: 5.0

result:
  success: true
  result_details:
    execution_time: 8.5
    error_code: ""
    error_description: ""
    final_state: "object_grasped"
  metrics:
    success_rate: 0.87
    average_time: 7.2
    resource_usage:
      cpu_percent: 25.3
      memory_mb: 128.5
```

### Example 2: Navigation Skill
```
request:
  skill_type: "navigate"
  skill_params:
    target_location: "kitchen sink"
    path_type: "shortest"
    speed_profile: "normal"
  constraints:
    timeout: 120.0
    max_retries: 2
    safety_limits:
      min_distance: 0.5
      max_speed: 0.5

result:
  success: true
  result_details:
    execution_time: 45.2
    error_code: ""
    error_description: ""
    final_state: "at_destination"
  metrics:
    success_rate: 0.94
    average_time: 42.1
    resource_usage:
      cpu_percent: 18.7
      memory_mb: 96.3
```

## Validation Rules
- `skill_type` must be one of the supported skill types
- `timeout` must be positive
- `max_retries` must be non-negative
- `progress` must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- `success_rate` and `average_time` in metrics must be positive values
