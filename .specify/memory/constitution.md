# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation – Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
100% spec-driven development: every chapter, section, and claim originates from this constitution and subsequent specs; All factual statements must be directly traceable to cited sources; Minimum 60% of all references must be peer-reviewed papers

### Accuracy Through Primary Source Verification
Accuracy through primary source verification only; Source priority order: 1. Peer-reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings, 2. Official technical reports from recognized institutions/companies, 3. Authoritative books and PhD theses, 4. Credible industry whitepapers; All diagrams, tables, code snippets, or photos must have a traceable source or be originally created and marked as such

### Maximum Transparency and Reproducibility
Maximum transparency and reproducibility; Zero tolerance for unverified claims or plagiarism; All code examples must be testable and include a GitHub repository link; Writing clarity target: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 11–13 (readable by senior CS undergraduates and graduate students)

### Technical Standards and Deployment
Publishing platform: Docusaurus v3+; Deployment target: Github pages; Development Framework: Specify-kit Plus + claude code; Version control: Git with structured commit history; Final deployment: GitHub Pages (publicly accessible URL required)

### Quality and Compliance
Book successfully builds with Spec-Kit Plus without errors; Live deployment on GitHub Pages passes Google Lighthouse score ≥90; Zero unresolved fact-check flags after internal review; All sources verifiable and links working at time of publication; Plagiarism policy: 0% tolerance (all drafts must pass Turnitin or equivalent with <3% similarity excluding references and code)

### Content Constraints
Total book length: 20,000–35,000 words (excluding references and appendices); Minimum 80 total sources across the entire book; Minimum 15 sources per major chapter; Citation style: APA 7th edition (in-text + reference list)

## Academic Standards
Designed for a technical/academic audience with computer science and engineering background; Tone: professional, precise, academic but approachable

## Development Workflow
Every diagram, table, code snippet, or photo must have a traceable source or be originally created and marked as such; All code examples must be testable and include a GitHub repository link

## Governance
All development must follow spec-driven development principles; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with citation and source requirements; All factual statements must be directly traceable to cited sources; Book must be built with Docusaurus v3+ using Spec-Kit Plus templates
